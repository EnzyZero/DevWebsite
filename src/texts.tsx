Hi, my name is Jakob Petracek, and I’m an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in the underlying systems and mechanics that make technology work. 
I’m especially eager to deepen my understanding of low-level computer architecture and systems — but that doesn't mean I’m overlooking higher-level languages and technologies like Java, C#, and JavaScript.
</p><p>
My programming journey may have started recently, but it has already been an incredibly enriching experience. 
I began with Python and JavaScript just before university, then moved on to C in my first semester and C++ in my second. 
Around that time, I also started programming with Vim on an Arch Linux machine.

In my third semester, I built this website, learned Java and C#, rented a domain, and set up a homelab server. 
I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and spend much of my free time working on personal projects — feel free to explore the sections below!
</p>
<p>Here are most of the technologies I've used for at <strong>least two weeks</strong> throughout my journey:</p>
