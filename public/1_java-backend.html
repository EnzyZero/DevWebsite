<h1>Java Beehive Monitoring Backend</h1>
<h2>07/2025</h2>
<p>
The first thing I did in my summer break was to learn Java. 
I had to know the language for my upcoming exchange semester as the university taught and used
it. After grinding java.dev tutorials for two weeks, I thought about a project which could give me
some hands on practise with Java: making a backend app which recieves messages over MQTT from other devices,
collect weather data and the sending devices' states (online/offline) and saves that to a sql database.
</p><p>
As my family runs some beehives, I planned on building a system with sensors on each hive to track
weight, temperature and humidity. So I began building the backend needed for this, using Java, Gradle
as a build tool and writing a few lines of sql for the PostgreSQL database. The app produces a bunch of logs
to help backtrack actions should issues arise during runtime - it is supposed to run basically forever after all.
</p><p>
It was a really good opportunity to prepare for my Java classes, I especially experimented around with the 
reflection capabilities of Java. The Backend uses annotations to register 'components'. Before the app starts, 
the classpath is scanned for classes containing these components, scanning their dependencies, solving the 
dependency graph with Kahn's Algorithm and instantiating each component with the right dependency.
</p><p>
I knew that such dependency-injection libraries existed, but I wanted to try make on my own, it is really
minimal, just containing as much functionality as I needed, but it really improved the code-quality 
by reducing code couplement and less dependency headaches.
